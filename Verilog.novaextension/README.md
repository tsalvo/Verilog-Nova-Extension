**Verilog** provides basic (and likely incomplete) syntax highlighting for the **Verilog** (.v or .V files) or **System Verilog** (.sv or .SV files) languages.

It can also be used as a linter for your source files if you have [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator) installed on your machine. An easy way to do this is via [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and typing the command `brew install verilator`.
